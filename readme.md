#Trapd2html

Simple utility that dumps the contents of HP Openview NNMi 6.x/7.x trapd.conf files to HTML.

Useful for documenting, migration, and for reference (you don't need to log in into the server to check incident configuration).

Usage:

```shell
bash$ trapd2html.pl trapd.conf
```

Output file is *eventos.html*

Requires Perl5. Nothing more.
